Enjin Platform is the most powerful and advanced open-source framework for building NFT Platforms.

## Requirements

Please make sure you have Go installed in your machine. You can check it by typing:
```bash
go version
# go version go1.18.1 linux/amd64
```

If you don't have it, you can find instructions on how to install it in [here](https://go.dev/learn/).

## Installation

You should add to your composer.json:

```json
{
  "require": {
    "enjin/platform-core": "dev-master"
  },
  "repositories": [
    {
      "type": "vcs",
      "url": "git@github.com:enjin/platform-core.git"
    }
  ]
}
```

You can then run `composer install` to have it installed in your laravel application.
After that you will need to build one dependency by typing:

```bash
cd vendor/gmajor/sr25519-bindings/go && go build -buildmode=c-shared -o sr25519.so . && mv sr25519.so ../src/Crypto/sr25519.so
```

This package will load its migrations automatically, execute them by running:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="platform-core-config"
```


## Usage

First, you should sync your platform with a snapshot of Efinity state:
```bash
php artisan platform:sync
```

After that you need to start fetching the blocks from the blockchain:
```bash
php artisan platform:ingest
```

Then you should start the processor to update your local database:
```bash
php artisan queue:work

# Or, if you're using Laravel Horizon
php artisan horizon
```

Finally, you may start the development server to access the API by running:
```bash
php artisan serve
```

You will find the GraphiQL playground on:
```
http://localhost:8000/graphiql
```
